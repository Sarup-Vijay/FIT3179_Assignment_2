      <h1>Australia’s Emissions: the story since 1990</h1>
      <p class="kicker">
        A visual brief for Australians: where we sit globally, what’s driving our CO₂, and how our per-person footprint compares with our neighbours.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        <strong>Purpose.</strong> Carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions play a significant role in shaping the enviornment. This visualisation explores key data on 
        Australia's CO₂ output, offering insights into how different sectors contribute to the national total over time. 
      </p>

      <ul class="note" style="margin-top:.6rem">
        <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Australia, 1990 – present, with regional peers for context.</li>
        <li><strong>What you’ll see:</strong> a world map, a fuel-mix stack, per-capita trends, key Aussie metrics, and a global GHG split.</li>

    <h2>Where does Australia sit right now?</h2>
    <p class="note">Following map shows selected set of countries, each with circle representing one country. Both the size and the colour of the circle encode
      — CO₂ emissions per person in the latest year : means larger, darker circles signal higher per-capita emissions. Hovering reveals country name, 
      CO₂ per person, total national CO₂, its share of global CO₂, and the year. Using per-capita values helps compare energy systems and lifestyles across 
      countries with very different populations</p>
    <div id="map" class="chart"></div>
    <p class="note">What stands out is that Australia’s per-person footprint is high: our circle is larger and darker than most in our region. 
      Neighbours vary widely — New Zealand is somewhat lower; Indonesia and India are much lower per person; Japan and the UK sit in the mid-to-high range. 
      It’s also important to distinguish totals from per-person measures: for example, China may show lower per-capita emissions than 
      Australia, yet contributes a larger share of global CO₂ because its population is far bigger. </p>

    <p class="note"> Key takeaway is that Australia’s per-capita emissions remain high relative to many peers, even as total 
    emissions move around over time. This sets up the next sections, where we unpack which sources drive Australia’s CO₂ and how our per-person trend has changed since 1990</p>

    <h2>What's driving Australia's CO₂?</h2>
    <p class="note">Stacked sources show coal, oil, gas, cement, flaring and land-use change contributions since 1990.</p>
    <div id="fuel" class="chart"></div>
    <p class="note">Coal is the dominant source, followed by oil and gas. Together, these three fossil fuels account for the vast majority of Australia's CO₂
      emissions. Cement production, flaring, and land-use change contribute smaller shares. Over time, coal's share has decreased slightly, while gas has increased. 
      Oil has remained relatively stable. The overall trend shows fluctuations in total emissions, with a peak around the mid-2000s followed by a gradual decline.
      The big picture: Australia’s total emissions are driven mainly by fossil fuels—especially coal—with only gradual shifts in 
       the mix over time</p>

    <h2>How do we compare with neighbours</h2>
    <p class="note">Per-capita emissions since 1990 across a small comparator set.</p>
    <div id="compare" class="chart"></div>
    <p class="note">Australia’s per-capita emissions have trended downwards since 1990, but remain high relative to many peers. 
      New Zealand has also seen a decline, though it started from a lower base. Japan and the UK have experienced significant reductions, reflecting shifts in 
      energy policy and efficiency measures. 
      Indonesia and India, while starting from much lower per-capita levels, have seen gradual increases as their economies grow. 
      The key takeaway is that while Australia has made progress in reducing its per-capita emissions, it still lags behind several of its regional peers.</p>

    <h2>Australia's key metrics at a glance</h2>
    <p class="note">Total CO₂, per-capita CO₂, and share of global CO₂. Read left-to-right for the change through time.</p>
    <div id="austats" class="chart"></div>
    <p class="note">Australia’s total CO₂ emissions have fluctuated over time, with a peak around the mid-2000s followed by a gradual decline. 
      Per-capita emissions have also trended downwards, reflecting improvements in energy efficiency and shifts in the energy mix. 
      However, Australia's share of global CO₂ emissions has remained relatively stable, indicating that while national efforts to reduce emissions are evident, 
      they have not significantly altered Australia's position in the global context. The overall picture is one of progress, but also of ongoing challenges in 
      addressing climate change on both a national and global scale.</p>

    <h2>Global greenhouse gases</h2>
    <p class="note">A simple global view across CO₂ (incl. land-use change), methane, and nitrous oxide.</p>
    <div id="ghg" class="chart"></div>
    <p class="note">CO₂ is the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, followed by methane and nitrous oxide. 
      CO₂ emissions have been steadily increasing over time, driven primarily by fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. 
      Methane emissions have also risen, largely due to agricultural activities and fossil fuel extraction. Nitrous oxide emissions have seen a more gradual increase, primarily from agricultural sources. 
      The overall trend indicates a growing challenge in managing greenhouse gas emissions globally, with significant implications for climate change mitigation efforts.</p>
